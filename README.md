# Project: Matrix Multiplier Mayhem - A Puzzle Game
**Core Concept**: Players must arrange and multiply matrices to transform "data streams" into desired outputs. It's like a circuit/pipeline puzzle but with matrix operations.

## Game Design
###The "Story"
- They are "Data Flow Engineers" who need to process raw data streams through transformation matrices to achieve target outputs.

## Game Mechanics
### Level 1-3: Learn the basics

- Given input matrix A and target output C

- Must find the correct transformation matrix B such that A × B = C

### Level 4-6: Multiple transformations

- Input A must go through TWO transformations: A × B × C = Target

- Players place matrices in the correct order

### Level 7+: The Inverse Challenge

- Given output C and transformation B, find the original input A (introducing matrix inverses)
